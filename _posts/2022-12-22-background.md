Young drivers are at higher risk of collisions due to inexperience and inappropriate driving behaviors. Based on Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s statistics, drivers aged 16-19 are nearly three times as likely as drivers aged 20 or older to be in a fatal crash. This is a safety and public health crisis in the United States but also an equity issue in that some teens experience more crashes than others: teens of color and with lower socioeconomic standings.

Teen drivers are at risk of dangerous driving circumstances due to immature driving and hazard perception skills. In an effort to impart safe driving skills, several states require teens to engage in an extended period of formal driver education (DE), including classroom or online courses and Behind-the-Wheel (BTW) training, before a teen obtains a driver’s license. For instance, Ohio’s GDL laws require that a teen under the age of 18 must, starting as early as 15.5 years old, engage in a minimum of 8 hours of BTW instruction with a licensed instructor in addition to in-person or online coursework and independent practice with a guardian if they intend to secure a full-privilege license before the age of 18 (The neighboring Pennsylvania State doesn't require driver education for teens to be licensed). This type of driver education and BTW training are usually expensive, costing  $\$$450 to $\$$530 in Ohio for 8-hour instruction.

Yet earlier studies with conflicting results on the efficacy of DE led to waning federal and state support and a decrease in the number of DE centers. This decline in DE centers coupled with an increase in DE costs may have degraded the access to DE by teens. I want to understand if teen driving training is an equity issue intertwined with one’s socioeconomic environment and physical access to educational resources. Are there disparities for teens to access driving training in Ohio, as it is an auto-oriented state yet with a few dense, urban cities? If the disparities in access to teen driving training exist, what's the relationships between low-driver-ed-access neighborhoods and crash outcomes? Are these neighborhood exposed to more frequent and severe crashes or less?


Therefore, my research questions/interests are:

- Where are spatial clusters of traffic crashes based on time, severity, and type in Columbus, OH MSA?

- Where are areas with least resources to access driving education and training (least spatial access and least financial affordability)?

- Are traffic crash clusters spatially associated with areas lacking access to driving education?
